# Loan-Prediction-based-on-customer-data
# **Objective**
The objective of this machine learning project is to build a model that accurately predicts whether a customer is eligible for a loan or not based on various attributes such as marital status, education, number of dependents, employment status, etc. Using various Classification algorithms, we aim to develop a robust model that accurately assesses whether a customer qualifies for a loan or not.

# **Overview**
Our project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Gather datasets containing loan application details (e.g., demographic data, income, credit history, loan amount, etc.).
Obtain historical data where loan approval decisions are already known.
2. **Data Exploration:** We conducted an in-depth analysis of the dataset to understand the impact of attributes like marital status, education, and employment status on loan eligibility.
3. **Data Preprocessing:** We handled missing values,Null values, outliers, and encoded categorical variables to prepare the data for model training.
4. **Odservation and Feature Analysis:** We explored trends and correlations in the data, uncovering insights into factors affecting loan approvals.
5. **Model Selection:**  We implemented and compared classification models, including Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest Classification, XGBClassification to determine the best-performing algorithm for loan prediction.
6. **Performance Evaluation:** The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Logistic Regression emerged as the superior model with an accuracy of 79% compared to KNN's 75%, Random Forest Classifier's 79%, XGBClassifier's 75%.
7. **Predicting Loan Status:** We used the Logistic Regression model to predict loan status for new customers and analyzed the results to gain further insights and predict loan status of each customer and analysed the results.


# **Key Features**
1. **Logistic Regression:** A powerful classification model that achieved an accuracy of 79%, effectively identifying eligible and ineligible loan applicants.
2. **Data Insights:** Analyzed patterns in the new customer data to identify trends such as the percentage of married individuals in semiurban areas who obtained loans.
3. **Data Insights:** Analyzed patterns in the new customer data to identify trends such as the percentage of married individuals in semiurban areas who obtained loans.
4. **Visualization:** Utilized visualizations to understand the distribution of loan status across different attributes like marital status and employment.

# **Insights and Analysis**

*The Logistic Regression model demonstrates superior performance compared to K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with a higher accuracy of 79% versus 75% versus 79% versus 75%.
*Both logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier algorithms have the same overall accuracy (79.2%), but when choosing between them, we must consider the performance metrics specific to our project's goals, particularly precision, recall, and f1-score for the target classes.Based on the metrics we used Logistic Regression. 
*Key insights from the new customer data reveal significant trends, such as the percentage of married individuals in semiurban areas who secured loans.
